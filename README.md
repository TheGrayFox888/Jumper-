# 🛡️ Jumper – A Dino Game Clone with a Medieval Twist

Hello, and thank you for checking out my project!

**Jumper** is a browser-based game inspired by the classic Dino game (like the one in Chrome). The goal is similar: jump over obstacles and survive as long as possible. But instead of a dinosaur, you play as a knight leaping over goblins in a medieval setting.

⚠️ *Please note: This game is still in development.*

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
