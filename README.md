ðŸ¦– Dino Game Clone â€“ JavaScript Project
Hello, and thank you for checking out my project!

This is my first attempt at creating a simple browser-based video game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Itâ€™s a clone of the classic Google Chrome Dino game, built as a learning exercise to improve my understanding of game loops, collision detection, and basic animations in JavaScript.

Tools Used:
HTML5
CSS3
JS
